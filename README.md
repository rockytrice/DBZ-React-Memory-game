<h1>DBZ is a memory game built with  Reactjs.</h1>

<p> This application  renders 12 different images  to the screen as well as  listens for click events.</p>

<p> The game also  keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time and also the  user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.</p>

 <p>Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page  shuffle's themselves in a random order.</p>

<p> Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.</p>
